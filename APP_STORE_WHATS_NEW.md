## Recommended Version (Concise):

Enhanced Marker Display & Accuracy

• Added collapsible nodes view with precise p1-p4 coordinates
• Marker IDs now displayed for easy reference
• Smart calibrated center display - only shown when different from raw
• Fixed coordinate calculations using Frame Origin reference
• Corrected width (X-axis) and length (Z-axis) measurements
• Real-time calibration updates when moving or resizing markers
• Improved data synchronization with server

This update ensures your spatial measurements are accurate and clearly presented for precision AR work.

## Alternative Version (More Detail):

What's New in This Release

MARKER BADGE IMPROVEMENTS
• Collapsible nodes section showing all corner coordinates (p1-p4)
• Color-coded x, y, z values for easy identification
• Marker ID displayed at bottom of badge
• Calibrated center intelligently hidden when matching raw values

ACCURACY FIXES
• Corrected coordinate system to use Frame Origin reference
• Raw center calculations now match server-stored values
• Fixed width/length axis alignment (X-axis = width, Z-axis = length)
• Improved coordinate precision throughout the app

REAL-TIME UPDATES
• Calibrated data refreshes immediately after marker transformations
• Single-call optimization for faster updates
• Frame-origin coordinates preserved during moves and resizes
• Better synchronization between local display and server

This update delivers more accurate spatial measurements and clearer data presentation for professional AR scanning workflows.
