# Roboscope 2 - Design Principles

## Typography
- **Never use bold text** - All text and labels should use regular font weight
- Use size variations for hierarchy, not weight
- Maintain clean, minimal typography throughout the app

## Visual Style
- Liquid glass effects for interactive elements
- Transparent, see-through UI components
- Minimal, functional design
- **Always follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines for UI**
- Use Apple's official liquid glass components and materials

Implementation reference: see `roboscope2/LIQUID_GLASS_GUIDE.md` for how we build Liquid Glass buttons and fallbacks.
