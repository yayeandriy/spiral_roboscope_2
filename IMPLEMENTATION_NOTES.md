# Roboscope 2 - Implementation Notes

## Completed Implementation

### Data Models ✅
- `DataModels.swift` - All Codable structures (Pose, PointCloud, Metrics, etc.)

### Core Services ✅
1. **CaptureSession** - ARKit session with mesh reconstruction and gravity alignment
2. **MeshFusionService** - Fuses ARMeshAnchors into deduplicated point cloud
3. **PreprocessService** - Confidence filter, voxel downsample, normals computation
4. **ModelLoader** - Loads USDZ and samples to point cloud
5. **CoarsePoseEstimator** - Multi-hypothesis seed generation
6. **ICPRefiner** - Point-to-plane ICP (simplified implementation)
7. **AlignmentCoordinator** - Orchestrates the full pipeline
8. **ARPlacementService** - Applies transforms to ModelEntity
9. **PersistenceService** - Save/load alignment results

### UI ✅
- **ContentView** - Full workflow with liquid glass buttons
- Scanning status display
- Metrics overlay
- Start/Stop/Align controls

## Required Manual Steps

### 1. Add Camera Permission to Info.plist
In Xcode:
1. Select your project in the navigator
2. Select the roboscope2 target
3. Go to the "Info" tab
4. Add a new entry:
   - Key: `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` (NSCameraUsageDescription)
   - Value: "This app uses the camera for AR room scanning and alignment"

### 2. Add USDZ Model Asset
1. Create or obtain a `Room.usdz` file
2. Drag it into the Assets folder in Xcode
3. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
4. Add to target membership

### 3. Device Requirements
- iOS 17+
- iPhone 12 Pro+ or iPad Pro 2020+ (LiDAR required)
- Test on physical device only (simulator doesn't support ARKit mesh reconstruction)

### 4. Build Settings
Ensure these are set in Xcode:
- Deployment target: iOS 17.0+
- Supported devices: iPhone, iPad
- Camera usage added to Info.plist

## Workflow

1. **Launch** → Model loads automatically
2. **Tap "Start inspection"** → Button splits into two circles
3. **Scanning** → AR session captures LiDAR mesh, point count shown in status
4. **Tap checkmark** → Runs alignment pipeline:
   - Preprocessing (voxel downsample, normals)
   - Coarse alignment (seed generation)
   - ICP refinement (multi-level)
   - Model placement in AR
5. **Tap X** → Stop scanning, reset

## Implementation Notes

### Simplifications Made
The implementation is functional but simplified in some areas:

1. **ICP** - Uses centroid alignment approximation instead of full point-to-plane optimization
2. **Normal computation** - Simplified PCA without full eigenvalue decomposition
3. **Correspondence search** - Brute force nearest neighbor (could use kd-tree)
4. **Model pyramid** - Reuses base cloud instead of proper downsampling

### Production Improvements
For production use, enhance:

1. Use Accelerate framework for matrix operations
2. Implement proper point-to-plane ICP solver
3. Add kd-tree for fast nearest neighbor search
4. Implement full PCA with eigenvalue decomposition
5. Add trimmed outlier rejection
6. Add heatmap visualization overlay
7. Implement relocalization with saved world maps
8. Add manual pose adjustment controls

## Design Principles
- No bold typography (per project constitution)
- Liquid glass UI elements
- Minimal, functional interface
